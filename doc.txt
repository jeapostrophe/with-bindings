> (with-binding bindings (single-name ...) body ...)

Evaluates the body expressions in an environment, where each 
  single-name is bound the value associated with single-name
              in bindings, if single-name is not present in
              bindings, it is bound to #f


> (with-bindings bindings 
                 (bool-name ...) 
                 (single-name ...) 
                 (multiple-name ...) 
                 body ...)

Evaluates the body in an environment where each
  bool-name      is bound to #t, if bool-name is present in bindings
                 and #f otherwise
  single-name    is bound the value associated with single-name
                 in bindings, if single-name is not present in
                 bindings, it is bound to #f
  multiple-name  is bound to a list of the values associated to
                 multiple-name in bindings, (if no bindings are
                 present, it is bound to the empty list)


> (with-bindings/default-values bindings 
    (bool-name ...) 
    ((single-name single-default) ...) 
    ((multiple-name multiple-default) ...) 
    body ...)

Evaluates the body in an environment where each
  bool-name      is bound to #t, if bool-name is present in bindings
  single-name    is bound to the value associated with single-name
                 in bindings, if single-name is not present in
                 bindings, then it is bound to the corresponding
                 single-default
  multiple-name  is bound to a list of the values associated to
                 multiple-name in bindings, if no bindings are
                 present, it is bound to the corresponding
                 multuple-default

> (with-bindings/defaults bindings 
    (bool-name ...) 
    ((single-name single-default-thunk) ...) 
    ((multiple-name multiple-default-thunk) ...) 
    body ...)

Evaluates the body in an environment where each
  bool-name      is bound to #t, if bool-name is present in bindings
  single-name    is bound to the value associated with single-name
                 in bindings, if single-name is not present in
                 bindings, then it is bound to the result of
                 calling single-default-thunk
  multiple-name  is bound to a list of the values associated to
                 multiple-name in bindings, if no bindings are
                 present, it is bound to the result of calling
                 the multiple-default-thunk
